# SpatialForge

Early-stage project. Current scope: a LiDAR capture validator and metadata inspector.

## Install

    pip install -e .[test]

## Usage

    python -m spatialforge validate-lidar "C:\path\to\capture"

Exit code: 0 = VALID / VALID WITH WARNINGS, 1 = INVALID, 2 = bad usage.

## Expected capture layout

    rgb.mp4            (optional, warning if missing)
    odometry.csv       (required) header: timestamp, frame, x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw, fx, fy, cx, cy, ...
    camera_matrix.csv  (optional) 3x3 intrinsics matrix
    imu.csv            (optional)
    depth/NNNNNN.png   (required) 16-bit grayscale
    confidence/NNNNNN.png (optional) 8-bit grayscale, levels 0..2

If the given folder contains a single sub-folder holding the capture, that
sub-folder is used automatically.

## Reconstruct a metric point cloud

    python -m spatialforge reconstruct-lidar "C:\spatialforge-data\single_room" --output "C:\temp\single_room.ply"

Writes an ASCII XYZ-only PLY (metres, in the capture's native world frame) and prints diagnostics:
frames used, point counts at each filtering step, camera-path and cloud extents, and a plausibility check.

Options: `--frame-step 30` (every Nth frame), `--max-frames 60` (evenly spaced cap, deterministic),
`--min-confidence 2` (levels are 0-2), `--voxel-size 0.02` (metres, keeps the first point per voxel),
`--min-range` / `--max-range` (metres), `--source-size WxH` (only if `rgb.mp4` cannot be read).

- **Depth scale:** 0.001 m per raw depth unit (`DEPTH_SCALE_M_PER_UNIT` in `lidar/geometry.py`). The PNGs do
  not state their unit, so this is an assumption supported by evidence: with poses in metres, multi-frame
  overlap peaks sharply at 0.001 on all three samples (0.67-0.74 vs <= 0.50 at 0.0005 and <= 0.31 at 0.002),
  and floors appear about 1.5 m below the handheld camera.
- **Intrinsics:** the odometry/camera-matrix intrinsics refer to the RGB image (1920x1440, read from
  `rgb.mp4`), not the 256x192 depth map. They are scaled proportionally (x 256/1920, y 192/1440; both 4:3,
  principal point near the RGB centre). Per-frame intrinsics from `odometry.csv` are preferred, with
  `camera_matrix.csv` as fallback.
- **Pose convention:** `x y z qx qy qz qw` is camera-to-world, `world = R(q) @ p_cam + t`, with camera
  axes +X right, +Y down, +Z forward. The other three interpretations (world-to-camera, and Y/Z-flipped
  camera axes) gave 0.01-0.11 neighbour-frame overlap vs 0.41-0.74 for this one. The world Y axis is vertical.
- **Limitations:** no floor/wall/ceiling extraction, no reorientation into a floor-plan frame, and no drift
  correction yet. Odometry drift is not removed, so large scans may show some misalignment.

## Drift correction ablation

    python -m spatialforge correct-lidar-drift "C:\spatialforge-data\single_scan_floor_only" --output-dir "C:\temp\drift_floor_only"

The supplied odometry is not simply trusted: the command registers the depth clouds of sampled frames,
optimises a pose graph, and compares a baseline reconstruction (OFF, supplied poses) with a corrected one
(ON) on identical frames, filtering and voxel size. Needs Open3D (CPU).

Method: odometry gives the initial guess; point-to-plane ICP refines consecutive sampled frames
(5 cm registration voxel); a few conservative loop closures are added where the camera returns to an
earlier place (far apart in the sequence, close in odometry space, similar heading) and ICP passes
stricter gates; Open3D optimises the pose graph. Every consecutive pair keeps an odometry edge as an
anchor, sequential ICP edges get a small weight and loop closures full weight. Roll/pitch stay as supplied
(only heading and position may change). All thresholds are in `DriftOptions` / `AcceptanceRules`
(`lidar/drift.py`) and are written into the report.

Safe fallback: an ICP result that fails its fitness / RMSE / correction-size gates is rejected and that
pair keeps its odometry relation. The corrected poses are only used if the before/after metrics agree
(no metric meaningfully worse, at least one meaningfully better, footprint and correction sizes plausible);
otherwise the report says `"accepted": false` and `"production_poses": "original"`.

Artifacts in `--output-dir`: `before.ply`, `after.ply`, `before_topdown.png`, `after_topdown.png`
(same bounds, scale and contrast), `drift_report.json`, `trajectory_before.csv`, `trajectory_after.csv`.
`before.ply` is identical to `reconstruct-lidar` with the same options. `after.ply` is always the corrected
candidate, even when rejected, so the ablation can be inspected.

Use enough frames for neighbouring frames to overlap (default `--max-frames 400`; 80 frames of a 9,745-frame
capture were too far apart for ICP to register most pairs). Structural extraction is not implemented yet.
